##### 助动词

助动词be能够与主要动词的过去分词一起构成被动语态，即**be done**结构

Chinese **is widely** used around the world nowadays.

The window **was broken** by the naughty boy just now.

Your watch **has already** been repaired.

助动词be构成的特殊语句:

1、be going to do 

be going to do表示“打算或将要”。如： 

He is going to visit us next week.

It is going to rain soon.

2、be about to do 

be about to do表示“刚要，即将”。与be going to do表“将要”不同的是，be about to do表示的是说完话后马上就要去做或是短期内马上就要去做。如： 


The plane is about to take off in five minutes' time. 


3、be to do 

be to do表示“按计划要做”。如： 


One night an angel came to Mary and told her that she was to have this special boy.

The new store is to be opened tomorrow.


#####  特殊句型中的be 


（一）There be句型 

与上面用法都不同的是，be可以与there一起构成there be句型，用来表示存在。考虑到There be句型较为重要，内容较多，在此不做赘述，后面再找时间跟大家单独分享。今天就先给几个常见的例句。 

There is a white ruler on the desk.

There were a great many people in the car race last year.


（二）祈使句中的be 

这种情况下，句子一般以Be开头或是Don't be开头，表示命令或建议等。如： 

Be patient! （耐心点！）

Don't be so hard on me! （不要对我们这么严厉！）


（三）虚拟语气中的be 

be有时可以放在句首，引起虚拟语气。如： 

Be he rich or poor, she will marry him.   

Be it true or not, she will see it herself.
此时的be引导的句子其实相当于一个让步状语从句。以上两句话就相当于： 

Whether he be rich or poor, she will marry him. （无论他是否有钱，她都会嫁给她。） 

Whether it be true or not, she will see it herself. （无论这是否是真的，她都会亲自去见证。）
